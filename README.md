# Group-recommendation-system

# Description:
A group recommendation system provides recommendations for a group of users rather than individuals. The challenge lies in:

* Aggregating preferences from multiple users

* Dealing with conflicting tastes in the group

In this project, we’ll simulate a group of users selecting movies based on their collective preferences using a simple group aggregation method (e.g., majority voting or averaging ratings).

# ✅ What It Does:
* Simulates ratings from multiple users for different movies

* Computes the average rating for each movie to generate group recommendations

* Recommends the top N movies based on collective preferences
